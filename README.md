# Todo_App

On my journey of learning and working with Vue.js, I built a Todo app to practice working with components, Vue router, animation, ... My main focus when I started this project was to pratice my UI/UX skills for the coming project in the future. The front-end of this Todo app was built in the mobile size first, connecting to the back-end that used Node.js and MongoDB.

This is the link to the web app. Please feel free to check it out and give me feedbacks, thank you!
